## Meeting summary

The objectives of the meeting were:
* Inform about the status of the ongoing pilot activities, including the Pilot Final report and the geospatial HVD tagging good practice candidate.
* Explain how the harvesting in [data.europa.eu](https://data.europa.eu/en) with a detailed presentation delivered by con terra/OP.
* Provide a summary of the pilot issues, its status, and on a selected set of issues (detailed in the agenda).
* Provide and update of the work of the DCAT-AP schema plugin for GeoNetwork working gorup lead by BE-Flanders.
* Agree on the next steps in view of finishing the pilot work by June 2025. 

### Pilot status & progress	

The JRC provided a short presentation reporting the ongoing pilot activities.

* A first draft of the Pilot Final report is available [here](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/GeoDCAT-AP-pilot/tree/main/final-report).
Additional contributions by participants, particularly to each participant's seccion in Chapter 3 and 4, are expected before the next pilot meeting. Deadline traced in the actions.

* The [geospatial HVD tagging good practice candidate](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/GeoDCAT-AP-pilot/tree/main/good-practices/hvd-tagging) is ready. After the conciliation meetings with Member States which expressed concerns about the good practice, the whole 19 Member States which participated in the consultation voted positively. The plan is to present this good practice candidate for endorsement in the [82 INSPIRE MIG-T Meeting](https://wikis.ec.europa.eu/spaces/InspireMIG/pages/177046460/82nd+MIG-T+meeting+2025-06-27).

### Harvesting in [data.europa.eu](https://data.europa.eu/en)	

con terra delivered on behalf of the OP a presentation explaining how the harvesting in [data.europa.eu](https://data.europa.eu/en) works, including a detailed description of the harvesting process, where the transformation to GeoDCAT-AP takes place, the role of the Geoharvester in the workflow, and the capabilities of this component.

The Geoharvester has been already updated to comply to GeoDCAT-AP 3 and is now able to process the geospatial HVD taging good practice candidate, and is available in the development environment. conterra tested with this system the catalogues from participating MSs in this environment. Any feednack is welcome.

The presentation is available [here](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/GeoDCAT-AP-pilot/blob/main/meetings/2025-04-28/presentations/20250428_02_Harvesting_in_data.europa.eu-OPconterra.pdf).

### Pilot issues and relevant discussion	

The JRC presented an [Excel spreadsheet](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/GeoDCAT-AP-pilot/blob/main/final-report/ISO-GeoDCAT-AP_Pilot_issues_v1_20250428.xlsx) summarising the Pilot issues received so far, showing its status.

Many issues have been already identified to be ready for their submission to SEMIC. On the other hand, a selected set of issue were selected for discussion in this meeting (detailed in the agenda and in the discussion overview below).

The participants discussed about the specific topics summarised below:
