### Relevant discussion	

The participants discussed about the specific pilot bits summarised below:

###  High-Value Datasets (geospatial) tagging Good practice candidate

* PENDING
  
###  DCAT-AP schema plugin for GeoNetwork – Status and call for testing 

* BE-Flanders provided an update of te activities of the 'DCAT-AP schema plugin integration in GeoNetwork’ Working Group. A new DCAT-AP plugin is available for this open sources application. Pilot participants are invited to take part in the next sprints of the 'DCAT-AP schema plugin integration in GeoNetwork’ Working Group, and mainly in the testing of the GeoNetwork pluging currently available.

## Actions

The following agreements were reached between the pilot participants.

* XXX
* Analyse the pilot issues published on GitHub ([Pilot repository](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/GeoDCAT-AP-pilot/issues) / [SEMIC GeoDCAT-AP repository](https://github.com/SEMICeu/GeoDCAT-AP/issues) / [SEMIC XSLT repository](https://github.com/SEMICeu/iso-19139-to-dcat-ap/issues)) and the [pilot progress presentations](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/GeoDCAT-AP-pilot/tree/main/meetings/2025-01-23/presentations) delivered in this meeting, summarising the results achieved by participants until the date.
* Participants to consider the use of [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/GeoDCAT-AP-pilot/issues) for sharing additional issues and outcomes stemming from the pilot, for their potential discussion and integration with the rest of participants' results.
* Start the first draft of the Pilot Final Report and promote contributions and discussion by the next pilot meeting.
* Pilot participants to consider taking part in the next sprints of the 'DCAT-AP schema plugin integration in GeoNetwork’ Working Group, and mainly in the testing of the GeoNetwork pluging currently available. See related presentation ([DCAT-AP schema plugin for GeoNetwork – Status and call for testing](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/GeoDCAT-AP-pilot/blob/main/meetings/2025-01-23/presentations/20250123_GeoDCAT-AP_Pilot-04_DCAT-AP_Plugin_GeoNetwork-BE-Flanders.pptx)) and the [working group repository](https://github.com/metadata101/dcat-ap) for more details.
* Fourth Meeting of the pilot to be scheduled by sending a new poll after having analysed the issues received so far. It will be mainly dedicated to discussing the most relevant open issues.
