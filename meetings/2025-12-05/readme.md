## Meeting summary

The objectives of the meeting were:
* restart the activity after the end of Phase 1.
* provide information on the update of the SEMIC assets - the GeoDCAT-AP specification and XSLT transformation (presented by SEMIC), news from data.europa.eu (by OP).
* propose concrete objectives and a working plan proposal for Phase 2 (by JRC).
* report on relevant participant's updates, including feedback from Phase 1, needs and interests for Phase 2.
* discuss and agree on the final objectives and related organisational matters.

### Pilot working plan (JRC)

The JRC provided a short overview of the activities performed during Phase 1 of the Pilot (October 2024 – June 2025). The focus was put in summarising the main results achieved, the conclusions and the remaining challenges in Phase 2, expected to span from December 2025 until February 2027.
These challenges include:
* smooth integration of geospatial metadata into data.europa.eu (support to MS, geospatial data filtering in the catalogue, etc.).
* quantitive evaluation of metadata transformation maturity.
* consistency and timely update of all transformation assets available, beyond those from SEMIC.
* specific aspects, such as a common approach for describing data services and API endpoints, and the evaluation of potential metadata information losses when INSPIRE-compliant metadata records are transformed into GeoDCAT-AP.

Subsequently, the JRC presented a working plan proposal for Phase 2, expected to run from December 2025 until February 2027. The [proposal](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/GeoDCAT-AP-pilot/blob/main/meetings/2025-12-05/presentations/20251205_03_ISO%26GeoDCAT-AP_Pilot_Ph%202-Working_plan-JRC.pptx) included a list of objectives and potential working teams taking into account the previously mentioned challenges. 

The aim of the proposal was to gather feedback from participants and promote active discussion between them to reach consensus on the final objectives and working plan for Phase 2. 

### Participant's updates (Pilot reports from Member States)
Each participant presented a short national report, including news on their progress with the transformation from ISO to GeoDCAT-AP, the status of migration of their tools to DCAT / GeoDCAT-AP v3, and any other topics considered of interest. The Member States were expressely requested to:
* provide feedback on Phase 1 to identify any issues and/or gaps, aspects to be changed or improved in Phase 2.
* state their expectations and main interests in Phase 2.

The countries mainly highlighted the following needs:
* Follow up and coordination with the policy process for the revision of the INSPIRE Directive (DK, FI, FR). 
* Follow up and coordination with the ISO/AWI TS 19115-5 working group (Geographic information — Metadata Part 5: DCAT mapping) (DK, FI, NL).
* Coordination between the different existing transformations, at EU, national and sofware level (DK). 
    * Engagement with the GeoNetwork community for doing so with those available in this software tool (DK, FI, NL).
    * Engagement with the CKAN community for the same purpose. 
* Coordination between the pilot and the SEMIC roadmaps (NL).
* Analyse the potential updates needed for the INSPIRE Technical guidelines (IT).
* Remind the procedure on how to tag issues in the SEMIC repositories (FR), provide example implementations (FR).
* Present the results from the first High-Value Datasets reporting to incentivise Member States (SK).

Unfortunately, there was no time to deliver the report from BE-Flanders. This country will be given a longer space for providing their report in the next pilot meeting. 

### Open discussion

After an active and productive discussion between participants, and considering their feedback and updates (previous agenda item), and agreement was reached on the working plan for Phase 2. Stated below.

## Agreements / Actions

### Working teams: Objectives & Tasks

**Action 1**. The JRC will set two ad-hoc working teams (the first one split in two sub-teams) will be set to focus on different aspects and the challenges mentioned above:

* **Working team T-1**. Support to the alignment of INSPIRE to data.europa.eu:
  
    * **Sub-working team T-1A**. Management of geospatial metadata harvesting and reporting issues.
 
      _Objective_: A forum for discussing issues, submitted (or to be submitted) to the relevant SEMIC GitHub repositories in the scope of geospatial datasets reporting (ISO / INSPIRE to GeoDCAT-AP), including geospatial High-Value Datasets.
      
      _Tasks_:
      - Identification of potential harvesting and reporting issues in the SEMIC repositories
      - Community discussion and agreement on targeted solutions in GeoDCAT-AP
      - GeoDCAT-AP specification and XSLT transformation updates (by SEMIC)
      - Inputs for / Outputs from T-1B working team

    * **Sub-working g team T-1B**. Specific analysis and good practices for INSPIRE-data.europa.eu alignment.
 
      _Objective_: Team for performing specific analysis, discussing on and formalising common good practices in the scope of the alignment and integration of INSPIRE into data.europa.eu.

      _Tasks_:
      - Drafting the Geospatial High-Value Datasets tagging good practice specification
      - Analysis of potential metadata information losses in the ISO-to-GeoDCAT-AP transformation
      - Agreement on a good practice for describing Data Services / APIs
      - Discussion the need to cover (selected) remaining gaps (e.g., candidates: related  to INSPIRE / HVD reporting, geospatial data filtering in data.europa.eu, analysis of specific changes needed to the TGs)
      - Inputs for / Outputs from T-1A working team

* **Working team T-2**. Exploration of the use of AI-powered tools for metadata management.

  _Objective_: Team to explore and support the use of AI-assisted tools in metadata generation, and other potential uses in metadata management tasks.

  _Tasks_:
  - Exploration and testing of AI-assisted tools for metadata generation
  - Identification of other areas where AI-assisted tools may be used to support metadata management
  - Other tasks (to be agreed)

### Working Plan & Roadmap 
  
**Action 2**. The JRC will organise bi-monthly pilot (general) meetings starting from January-February 2026, with at least one monthly working team meetings (per each working team) in between (more if needed). A roadmap will be presented in the next pilot meeting.

**Action 3**. The JRC will contact the experts who volunteered to help pushing each working team from mid-January to mid-February 2026

**Action 4**. The JRC will kick-off the working teams as soon as possible, with the support of the mentioned experts.
