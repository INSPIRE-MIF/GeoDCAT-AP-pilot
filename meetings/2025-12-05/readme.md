### Participant's updates (Pilot reports from Member States)
Each participant presented a short national report, including news on their progress with the transformation from ISO to GeoDCAT-AP, the status of migration of their tools to DCAT / GeoDCAT-AP v3, and any other topics considered of interest. The Member States were expressely requested to:
* provide feedback on Phase 1 to identify any issues and/or gaps, aspects to be changed or improved in Phase 2.
* state their expectations and main interests in Phase 2.

The countries mainly highlighted the following needs:
* Follow up and coordination with the policy process for the revision of the INSPIRE Directive (DK, FI, FR). 
* Follow up and coordination with the ISO/AWI TS 19115-5 working group (Geographic information — Metadata Part 5: DCAT mapping) (DK, FI, NL).
* Coordination between the different existing transformations, at EU, national and sofware level (DK). 
    * Engagement with the GeoNetwork community for doing so with those available in this software tool (DK, FI, NL).
    * Engagement with the CKAN community for the same purpose. 
* Coordination between the pilot and the SEMIC roadmaps (NL).
* Analyse the potential updates needed for the INSPIRE Technical guidelines (IT).
* Remind the procedure on how to tag issues in the SEMIC repositories (FR), provide example implementations (FR).
* Present the results from the first High-Value Datasets reporting to incentivise Member States (SK).
