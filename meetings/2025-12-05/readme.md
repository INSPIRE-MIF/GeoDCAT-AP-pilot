Note that resoved issues are tagged as 'status:resolution-provided' in the corresponding repositories: [specification](https://github.com/SEMICeu/GeoDCAT-AP/) / [XSLT](https://github.com/SEMICeu/iso-19139-to-dcat-ap/issues?q=label%3Astatus%3Aresolution-provided)

Detailed explanation of each of the issues resolved were provided in the presentation.

On the other hand,
* 8 GeoDCAT-AP specification issues are still pending for feedback (tagged as 'feedback-requested' in the corresponding repositories):
    * Pilot-specific: [#142](https://github.com/SEMICeu/GeoDCAT-AP/issues/142), [#150](https://github.com/SEMICeu/GeoDCAT-AP/issues/150), [#154](https://github.com/SEMICeu/GeoDCAT-AP/issues/154)
    * Others: [#135](https://github.com/SEMICeu/GeoDCAT-AP/issues/135), [#139](https://github.com/SEMICeu/GeoDCAT-AP/issues/139), [#140](https://github.com/SEMICeu/GeoDCAT-AP/issues/140), [#147](https://github.com/SEMICeu/GeoDCAT-AP/issues/147), [#151](https://github.com/SEMICeu/GeoDCAT-AP/issues/151)

* 6 XSLT issues are still pending for feedback
    * Pilot-specific: [#71](https://github.com/SEMICeu/iso-19139-to-dcat-ap/issues/71), [#72](https://github.com/SEMICeu/iso-19139-to-dcat-ap/issues/72)
    * Others: [#74](https://github.com/SEMICeu/iso-19139-to-dcat-ap/issues/74), [#77](https://github.com/SEMICeu/iso-19139-to-dcat-ap/issues/77), [#78](https://github.com/SEMICeu/iso-19139-to-dcat-ap/issues/78), [#84](https://github.com/SEMICeu/iso-19139-to-dcat-ap/issues/84)

SEMIC also raised some questions: 
* on the versioning of the next GeoDCAT-AP draft - either v3.0.1 or v3.1.0: the community expressed preference for the second one, since a new property (Purpose) was added to this draft specification.
* on SHACL shapes namespace prefix: [#145](https://github.com/SEMICeu/GeoDCAT-AP/issues/145)

Some of the issues identified during Phase 1 of the pilot, from those referenced in the [issues summary spreadsheet](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/GeoDCAT-AP-pilot/blob/main/final-report/ISO-GeoDCAT-AP_Pilot_issues_v3_FinalReport.xlsx), might have not been identifed yet to be resolved by SEMIC. There is a need to come back to them to check its status.

The JRC informed that the [issues summary spreadsheet](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/GeoDCAT-AP-pilot/blob/main/final-report/ISO-GeoDCAT-AP_Pilot_issues_v3_FinalReport.xlsx) was updated until July 2025 when the [Pilot Phase 1 Final Report](https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2760/9289518) was in process of publication.
The JRC will check the spreadsheet and will promote the transfer of specification and XSLT-related issues into the SEMIC repositories.

Additionally, The JRC proposed to stick to the SEMIC repositories ([specification](https://github.com/SEMICeu/GeoDCAT-AP/issues) / [XSLT transformation](https://github.com/SEMICeu/iso-19139-to-dcat-ap/issues/)) for new issues identified in Phase 2 of the pilot, if possible only using the [pilot repository](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/GeoDCAT-AP-pilot/issues) for pilot organisational matters.

### data.europa.eu / Geoharvester updates (OP / con terra)	

The OP clarified where the ISO 19139 to GeoDCAT-AP metadata transformation is taking place for ingesting data into data.europa.eu
* Option A. In the European Data Portal Geoharvester - this option is used to harvest and transform geospatial ISO metadata from CSW national discovery endpoints. It requires that the geospatial High-Value Datasets tagging good practice is properly used in ISO metadata records. 
* Option B. Directly deliver national (Geo-)DCAT-AP metadata to the European Data Portal - these metadata are harvested from data.europa.eu, the responsibility of the ISO to GeoDCAT-AP transformation remains on the countries.

14 geocatalogues are currently opting for Option A for ingesting geospatial information into the European Data Portal, which may be complemented with other geospatial information present in the national open data catalogues.

Additionally, the OP provided details about the data.europa.eu Geoharvester. This system has its own XSLT transformation (not the SEMIC reference one) and it is aligned to GeoDCAT-AP v3 since January 2025. Furtheremore it implements the agreements on the geospatial High-Value Datasets tagging good practice. Updated documentation is available [here](https://dataeuropa.gitlab.io/data-provider-manual/hvd/annotation_in_geometadata/).

The OP periodically follows up the updates on the SEMIC XSLT transformation in order to update data.europa.eu transformation when necessary. Specifically, the OP is also preparing documentation explaining the differences between the SEMIC reference XSLT transformation and the one used by the Geoharvester. 

In the future, data.europa.eu is planning: 
* the alignment to the new version of the SEMIC reference XSLT.
* an update of libraries.
* to support to dataset series.
* the enhancement of dataset distributions accordiing to the INSPIRE data-service linking simplification good practice.

### Pilot working plan (JRC)

The JRC provided a short overview of the activities performed during Phase 1 of the Pilot (October 2024 – June 2025). [Pilot Phase 1 Final Report](https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2760/9289518) was published in August 2025. 

The focus of the presentation was put in summarising the main results achieved, the conclusions and the remaining challenges in Phase 2, expected to span from December 2025 until February 2027.

These challenges include:
* smooth integration of geospatial metadata into data.europa.eu (support to MS, geospatial data filtering in the catalogue, etc.).
* quantitive evaluation of metadata transformation maturity.
* consistency and timely update of all transformation assets available, beyond those from SEMIC.
* specific aspects, such as a common approach for describing data services and API endpoints, and the evaluation of potential metadata information losses when INSPIRE-compliant metadata records are transformed into GeoDCAT-AP.

Subsequently, the JRC presented a working plan proposal for Phase 2, expected to run from December 2025 until February 2027. The [proposal](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/GeoDCAT-AP-pilot/blob/main/meetings/2025-12-05/presentations/20251205_03_ISO%26GeoDCAT-AP_Pilot_Ph%202-Working_plan-JRC.pptx) included a list of objectives and potential working teams taking into account the previously mentioned challenges. 

The aim of the proposal was to gather feedback from participants and promote active discussion between them to reach consensus on the final objectives and working plan for Phase 2. 

### Participant's updates (Pilot reports from Member States)
Each participant presented a short national report, including news on their progress with the transformation from ISO to GeoDCAT-AP, the status of migration of their tools to DCAT / GeoDCAT-AP v3, and any other topics considered of interest. The Member States were expressely requested to:
* provide feedback on Phase 1 to identify any issues and/or gaps, aspects to be changed or improved in Phase 2.
* state their expectations and main interests in Phase 2.

The countries mainly highlighted the following needs:
* Follow up and coordination with the policy process for the revision of the INSPIRE Directive (DK, FI, FR). 
* Follow up and coordination with the ISO/AWI TS 19115-5 working group (Geographic information — Metadata Part 5: DCAT mapping) (DK, FI, NL).
* Coordination between the different existing transformations, at EU, national and sofware level (DK). 
    * Engagement with the GeoNetwork community for doing so with those available in this software tool (DK, FI, NL).
    * Engagement with the CKAN community for the same purpose. 
* Coordination between the pilot and the SEMIC roadmaps (NL).
* Analyse the potential updates needed for the INSPIRE Technical guidelines (IT).
* Remind the procedure on how to tag issues in the SEMIC repositories (FR), provide example implementations (FR).
* Present the results from the first High-Value Datasets reporting to incentivise Member States (SK).

Check the [pilot progress presentations](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/GeoDCAT-AP-pilot/tree/main/meetings/2025-12-05/presentations) for more details. 

Unfortunately, there was no time to deliver the report from BE-Flanders. This country will be given a longer space for providing their report in the next pilot meeting.
