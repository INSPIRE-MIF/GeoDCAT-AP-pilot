# GeoDCAT-AP-pilot

This repository is intended to store, share and manage documentation and information relative to the **ISO &amp; GeoDCAT-AP metadata Implementation Pilot**, carried out by the INSPIRE community.

## Pilot description

The GeoDCAT-AP pilot is intended to test and evaluate the adequacy of the transformation of geospatial (ISO 19139-based) metadata into a  DCAT-based metadata using the [GeoDCAT-AP 3.0.0](https://semiceu.github.io/GeoDCAT-AP/releases/3.0.0/) specification and its related [XSLT transformation](https://github.com/SEMICeu/iso-19139-to-dcat-ap/tree/main).

For more infomation about the pilot, its purpose, objectives and outputs/results and expected benefits, please read the [Pilot Concept Note](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/GeoDCAT-AP-pilot/blob/main/20241119_GeoDCAT-AP_Pilot-Concept_Note-v2.pdf).
