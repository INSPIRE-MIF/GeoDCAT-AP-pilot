# INSPIRE GeoDCAT-AP Pilot

This repository is intended to store, share and manage documentation and information relative to the **ISO &amp; GeoDCAT-AP metadata Implementation Pilot**, carried out by the INSPIRE community.

## Pilot description

The GeoDCAT-AP pilot is one of the activities aimed at modernising the implementation of European environmental geospatial data sharing under the [GreenDataForAll](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13170-GreenData4All-updated-rules-on-geospatial-environmental-data-and-access-to-environmental-information_en) initiative (revision of the [INSPIRE Directive](http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2007/2/2019-06-26)), aligning it to the [Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/138 on Open Data High-Value Datasets](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2023/138/oj).

Its main purpose is facilitating the integration of INSPIRE metadata, and the corresponding reporting obligations, into a common Open Data flow, centralising the INSPIRE and High-Value Datasets reporting in the [European Data Portal](https://data.europa.eu/en) (DEU). In particular, the pilot is intended to test and evaluate the adequacy of the transformation of geospatial (ISO 19139-based) metadata into a DCAT-based metadata using the [GeoDCAT-AP 3.0.0](https://semiceu.github.io/GeoDCAT-AP/releases/3.0.0/) specification and its related [XSLT transformation](https://github.com/SEMICeu/iso-19139-to-dcat-ap/tree/main).

The pilot is carried out as part of the activities of the [INSPIRE Maintenance and Implementation Work Programme (MIWP) 2021-2024](https://wikis.ec.europa.eu/display/InspireMIG/INSPIRE+work+programme+2021-24).
