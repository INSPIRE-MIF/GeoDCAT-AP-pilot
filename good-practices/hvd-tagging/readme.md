# Folder to store materials related to the good practice on Geospatial High-Value Datasets (HVDs) tagging

* The root of this folder contains the **final candidate good practice** presented during the [81 INSPIRE MIG-T Meeting](https://wikis.ec.europa.eu/spaces/InspireMIG/pages/152803212/81st+MIG-T+meeting+2025-02-14), which has been submitted for voting on its potential endorsement by MIG-T:

  * 'CANDIDATE-ISO_HVD_Tagging_Anchor_Multilingual-clarification.xml' file: represents the good practice candidate when using a multilingual ISO geospatial metadata record - The example shows a multilingual metadata record based on English as primary language, and dutch as secondary language.
  
  * 'CANDIDATE-ISO_HVD_Tagging_Anchor_Non-Multilingual-clarification.xml' file: represents the good practice candidate when using a monolingual ISO geospatial metadata record - The example shows a monolingual metadata record based on English as primary language.
 
  * 'MIG-T81_ISO_and_GeoDCAT-AP_Pilot_v1.pdf' file: a presentation explaining the details about the above-mentioned candidate good practice, including its two options (Multilingual and Non-multilingual).

* The rest of folders contain the materials used for discussing and agreeing on the above-mentioned good practice candidate: 

  * The folder **/implementation-examples** contain examples of ISO 19115 dataset metadata records implementing this (geospatial) High-Value Datasets tagging good practice.
    
  * The folder **/proposal-GN_GeoDCAT-AP_plugin_WG-Sprint_3** contains the proposal discussed during the 4th Sprint of the working group on the GeoDCAT-AP Schema plugin for GeoNetwork. 

  * The folder **/candidate-good-practice-GN_GeoDCAT-AP_plugin_WG-Sprint_4** contains the proposal discussed during the 4th Sprint of the working group on the GeoDCAT-AP Schema plugin for GeoNetwork.

  * The folder **/inputs** contains the initial examples shared by the participants in the pilot (including Member States), which were taken into account for discussing the previously mentioned proposals, and agreeing on the final candidate good practice.
