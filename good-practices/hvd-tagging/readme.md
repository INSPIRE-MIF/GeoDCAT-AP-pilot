* The root of this folder contains the **final candidate good practice** presented during the [80 INSPIRE MIG-T Meeting](https://wikis.ec.europa.eu/display/InspireMIG/80th+MIG-T+meeting+2024-12-13), which has been submitted for voting on its potential endorsement by MIG-T:

  * 'CANDIDATE-ISO_HVD_Tagging_Anchor_Multilingual.xml' file: represents the good practice candidate when using a multilingual ISO geospatial metadata record - The example shows a multilingual metadata record based on English as primary language, and dutch as secondary language.
  
  * 'CANDIDATE-ISO_HVD_Tagging_Anchor_Non-Multilingual.xml' file: represents the good practice candidate when using a monolingual ISO geospatial metadata record - The example shows a monolingual metadata record based on English as primary language.

* The rest of folders contain the materials used for discussing and agreeing on the above-mentioned good practice candidate: 

  * The folder **/proposal-GN_GeoDCAT-AP_plugin_WG-Sprint_3** contains the proposal discussed during the 4th Sprint of the working group on the GeoDCAT-AP Schema plugin for GeoNetwork. 

  * The folder **/candidate-good-practice-GN_GeoDCAT-AP_plugin_WG-Sprint_4** contains the proposal discussed during the 4th Sprint of the working group on the GeoDCAT-AP Schema plugin for GeoNetwork.

  * The folder **/inputs** contains the materials and examples shared by the participants in the pilot (including Member States), which were taken into account for discussing the previously mentioned proposals, and agreeing on the final candidate good practice.
